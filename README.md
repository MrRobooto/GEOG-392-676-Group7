# Wildfire Impacts on Crop Health

```Caitlyn Cline, Grayson May, Enrique Buruca, Bhavik Gupta, Angel Umana, Javier Camarillo```
- We are going to include three maps. One of crop health in 2021, wildfires in that area in 2022, and crop health in 2023.
- Wildfires have increased in frequency all around the world, and this includes Texas.
- Wildfire smoke has both positive and negative impacts on crops including:
  - Reduction in light availability (Negative)
  - Increased ozone at ground level (Negative)
  - Wildfire smoke can scatter sunlight (Positive)
  - The scattered sunlight can lower leaf temperatures, which can be helpful in a drought (Positive)
- We have decided to showcase the impacts on crop health by providing maps of crops before and after wildfires. We hope our maps will indicate the overall impact fire has on crop health.

For our project, we are using a dataset of the wildfire coverage across the US, the NDVI crop health coverage of the US, and the crop boundary layer data set.
